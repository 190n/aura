{-

  Simplify a parsed Bash script by replacing ${...} fields
  when their values are known. Does _not_ evaluate any expressions.
  That is:

  foo="bar"       # All instances of $foo will be replaced.
  baz=`uname -r`  # $baz will not be replaced anywhere.

  As all Bash variables are also secretly arrays, lines like
  ${foo[0]} or ${foo[@]} will also be respected and simplified.
