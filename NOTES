GENERAL

PKGBUILD ANALYSIS
-----------------
Develop a system for verifying PKBUILDs!
Does a PKGBUILD: Have code outside of build() or package()?
       		 Perform certain forbidden actions?
		 Download sources from fishy places?

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
-------------------
Outputting a sort of "dependency tree/graph" that shows how much certain
packages are depended on, and what packages use "fringe" dependencies.
The goal would be to reduce the amount of programs that use these fringe
dependencies, or make it so that they use more mainstream libraries, etc.

CACHE DIR
---------
Check `pacman.conf` for the location of the cache dir.
If a different one isn't specific then of course use the default.

SETTINGS
--------
In future, a `Settings` data type may have to be created to store
Language choice, Verbosity choice, Prompting choice, package cache location,
etc.
For Verbosity, it will stop suppressing makepkg output and activate
pacman verbosity as well.

WELCOME MESSAGE
---------------
When aura is used for the first time, print a welcome message explaining it
and its philosophy (no default prompting to view PKGBUILDs, etc).
After that, write a file called `.aura_used` to a predictable location.
When running aura, if that file does not exist, we know aura hasn't been
used yet.
If aura is run for the first time and a language flag is included, print
the welcome message in that language.

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------
-As -> `--search` Search for an AUR package
-Av -> `--verbose` Doesn't suppress makepkg output.
-Cc -> `--clean` Deletes old packages. Users can supply how many versions
       they want to keep.
-Cb? -> `--backup`? Backs up the package cache to a given directory.

OUT OF DATE
-----------
Once dependencies are determined, notify the user if any are O.o.D.

AURA ADVICE
-----------
Every once and a while show a tip. For example:
"Aura tip: Did you know you can use `-Qdt` to view all orphaned packages you
have installed?"
"Aura tip: `Ayu` is great for upgrading packages... it's also a tasty
Japanese fish."
"Aura tip: Did you know you can use Aura in different languages?
Run Aura with the flag `--languages` to find out which ones."

RUN BY ROOT USER
----------------
When run by the root user and not by sudo, check this and run makepkg
with --runasroot. This is not a safe procedure, but the user must be
responsible for their actions.
