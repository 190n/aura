GENERAL
-------
Protected package files? In a .conf file?
You could give a list of regexes for packages that you never want deleted.
When a `-Cc` comes along they wouldn't be deleted.

What of the license has to be present in the source code?

Calls to pacman should check for the `$PACMAN` var.

When outputing repo dependencies, show what repo they're from?

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT

-Ci -> `--info` Gives some stats about the package cache.
-   -> `--philosophy` Outputs the aura philosophy.
-   -> `--tutorial` Teach new users how to build packages from scratch.
