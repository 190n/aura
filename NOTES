GENERAL
-------
When outputing repo dependencies, show what repo they're from?

Move aura to haskell-http.

Create `auraup` script for upgrading aura when things break.

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------
- `Ci` `info` -> Gives some stats about the package cache.
- `restore` -> Restores a saved state.
  	       1. All packages are returned to whatever version
	       	  they used to be in the saved state.
	       2. Packages installed now but not in the saved state
	       	  are removed.
               3. Packages that should be restored to a previous
	       	  version but don't have the appropriate file in the
		  cache will be reported.

OUT OF DATE
-----------
Once dependencies are determined, notify the user if any are O.o.D.
