GENERAL
-------
Reorganize certain functions into a `Shell.hs`?
`getUser` and other functions could go here.
Also things like `system` and `rawSystem`.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
-------------------
Outputting a sort of "dependency tree/graph" that shows how much certain
packages are depended on, and what packages use "fringe" dependencies.
The goal would be to reduce the amount of programs that use these fringe
dependencies, or make it so that they use more mainstream libraries, etc.

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------
-As -> `--search` Search for an AUR package
-Ai -> `--info` Gives specific info on an AUR package.
-Ci -> `--info` Gives some stats about the package cache.
-   -> `--prompt` Prompt the user if they want to view PKGBUILDs.
       At program start up, lookup the `$EDITOR` variable and use that.
       If it doesn't exist, use `vi`. I guess.
-   -> `--philosophy` Outputs the aura philosophy.

FLAGS UNUSED BY PACMAN
----------------------
a j x z
(Of these [a x z] has been taken by Aura)

OUT OF DATE
-----------
Once dependencies are determined, notify the user if any are O.o.D.

RUN BY ROOT USER
----------------
When run by the root user and not by sudo, check this and run makepkg
with --runasroot. This is not a safe procedure, but the user must be
responsible for their actions.
