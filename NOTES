GENERAL
-------
When outputing repo dependencies, show what repo they're from?

Move aura to haskell-http.

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------
- `Ci` `info` -> Gives some stats about the package cache.

FIXING HOTEDIT
--------------
1. Before depchecks, ask the user if they want to edit.
2. Write the current PKGBUILD to a temp file, edit it, and read it back.
3. During the `build` stage, download the source, and overwrite the
   included PKGBUILD if and only if HOTEDIT is active.

OUT OF DATE
-----------
Once dependencies are determined, notify the user if any are O.o.D.
