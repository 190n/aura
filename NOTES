GENERAL
-------
Protected package files? In a .conf file?
You could give a list of regexes for packages that you never want deleted.
When a `-Cc` comes along they wouldn't be deleted.

What of the license has to be present in the source code?

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
-------------------
Outputting a sort of "dependency tree/graph" that shows how much certain
packages are depended on, and what packages use "fringe" dependencies.
The goal would be to reduce the amount of programs that use these fringe
dependencies, or make it so that they use more mainstream libraries, etc.

OPTIONS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------
-As -> `--search` Search for an AUR package
-Ai -> `--info` Gives specific info on an AUR package.
-Ci -> `--info` Gives some stats about the package cache.
-   -> `--philosophy` Outputs the aura philosophy.

FLAGS UNUSED BY PACMAN
----------------------
a j x z
(Of these [a x z] has been taken by Aura)

OUT OF DATE
-----------
Once dependencies are determined, notify the user if any are O.o.D.
