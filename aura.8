.SH NAME
aura \- A package manager for Arch Linux and the AUR.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIaura\fR <operation> [options] [package(s)]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fIaura\fR is a multi-lingual package manager for Arch Linux written in 
Haskell.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the Arch User
Repositories (AUR), allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
It allows \fIall\fR pacman operations and provides \fInew\fR custom ones
for dealing with AUR packages. This differs from some other AUR package
managers.
 
.SH OPERATIONS
.P
\-A, \-\-aursync
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the [A]UR. Default action installs packages
from the AUR. During building, makepkg output is \fInot\fR shown 
by default. After building, the built .pkg.tar.xz file is moved
to the package cache and installed from there. This allows for easy 
AUR package downgrading.
.RE 
.P
\-C, \-\-downgrade
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the package [C]ache. Default action downgrades
specified packages. This process is interactive, allowing the user to choose
from any previous version they have available in the package cache.
.RE
.P
\-L, \-\-logfile
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the pacman [L]ogfile.
Default action opens the log for read-only viewing.

dependencies, but are no longer required by any package. These can be removed
with \fI\-\-abandon\fR.

.SH LANGUAGES
.P
Aura is available in multiple languages. As options, they can be used
with either their English names or their native names written with
Roman characters. The available languages are, in option form:
.P
\-\-english
.P
\-\-japanese, \-\-nihongo

.SH SEE ALSO
.P
\fBpacman\fR(8), \fBpacman.conf\fR(5), \fBmakepkg\fR(8)

.SH BUGS
.P
It is not recommended to install non-ABS, non-AUR packages with pacman or
aura. Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a `-Au` and attempt
to upgrade them. If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is
a legitimate AUR package with the same name as the one you installed)
previous installations could be overwritten.
