.SH NAME
aura \- A package manager for Arch Linux and the AUR.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIaura\fR <operation> [options] [package(s)]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fIaura\fR is a multi-lingual package manager for Arch Linux written in 
Haskell.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the Arch User
Repositories (AUR), allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
It allows \fIall\fR pacman operations and provides \fInew\fR custom ones
for dealing with AUR packages. This differs from some other AUR package
managers.
 
.SH OPERATIONS
.P
\-A, \-\-aursync
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the [A]UR. Default action installs packages
from the AUR. During building, makepkg output is \fInot\fR shown 
by default. After building, the built .pkg.tar.xz file is moved
to the package cache and installed from there. This allows for easy 
AUR package downgrading.
.RE 
.P
\-C, \-\-downgrade
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the package [C]ache. Default action downgrades
specified packages. This process is interactive, allowing the user to choose
from any previous version they have available in the package cache.
.RE
.P
\-L, \-\-logfile
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the pacman [L]ogfile.
Default action opens the log for read-only viewing.
.RE

.SH AUR SYNC OPTIONS
.P
\-a, \-\-delmakedeps
.RS 4
Uninstalls build dependencies that are no longer required after installing
the main package. This prevents the creation of orphan packages. Also note
that while the package itself will be uninstalled, its package file will
remain in the cache.
.RE
.P
\-d, \-\-deps
.RS 4
View all the dependencies of a package. This process is recursive for
AUR packages, so all dependencies of dependencies (and so on) will also
be shown. This can aid the pre-install package research process.
.RE
.P
\-p, \-\-pkgbuild
.RS 4
Outputs an AUR package's PKGBUILD. Use this before installing new packages
to confirm that the build scripts aren't doing anything fishy.
.RE
.P
\-u, \-\-sysupgrade
.RS 4
Upgrade all installed AUR packages. \fI\-Au\fR is \fI\-Su\fR for AUR
packages.
.RE
.P
\-w, \-\-downloadonly
.RS 4
Download the source tarball. This doesn't contain source code, but instead
the PKGBUILD and .install file for the requested package. Running
\fImakepkg\fR in a directory with these files in it would build the package
manually.
.RE
.P
\-x, \-\-unsuppress
.RS 4
Unsuppress \fImakepkg\fR output during building. By default this output
is suppressed for a more silent install. Note that when this option
isn't used, \fImakepkg\fR output is actually collected and printed
if any errors occur.
.RE
.P
\-\-hotedit
.RS 4
Prompt the user immediately before a package is built to ask if they
wish to view/edit the PKGBUILD.
This is not default behavior and thus does not have a single\-letter option.
Research into packages (and by extension, their PKGBUILDs) should be done
before any building occurs. Please use \fI\-Ap\fR and \fI\-Ad\fR for this,
as they will be much faster at presenting information than searching the
AUR website manually.
.RE

.SH DOWNGRADE OPTIONS
.P

.SH LOGFILE OPTIONS
.P

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.P
These options do not require a superordinate flag, such as \fI\-A\fR.
.P
\-\-orphans
.RS 4
Display orphan packages. These are packages that were installed as
dependencies, but are no longer required by any package. These can be removed
with \fI\-\-abandon\fR.
.RE
.P
\-\-adopt
.RS 4
Deorphanize a package. Changes a package's install reason to `As Explicit`.
This is a shortcut for `-D --asexplicit`.
.RE
.P
\-\-abandon
.RS 4
Uninstall all orphan packages. 
.RE
.P
\-\-conf
.RS 4
View the pacman configuration file in read-only mode.
.RE
.P
\-\-languages
.RS 4
Display the available output languages.
.RE

.SH PACMAN / AURA DUAL FUNCTIONALITY OPTIONS
.P
\-\-noconfirm
.RS 4
Never ask for any Aura or Pacman confirmation. Any time a prompt would appear,
say before building or installation, it is assumed the user answered in
whatever way would progress the program.
.RE

.SH LANGUAGES
.P
Aura is available in multiple languages. As options, they can be used
with either their English names or their native names written with
Latin characters. The available languages are, in option form:
.P
\-\-english (default)
.P
\-\-japanese, \-\-nihongo

.SH SEE ALSO
.P
\fBpacman\fR(8), \fBpacman.conf\fR(5), \fBmakepkg\fR(8)

.SH BUGS
.P
It is not recommended to install non-ABS, non-AUR packages with pacman or
aura. Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a `-Au` and attempt
to upgrade them. If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is
a legitimate AUR package with the same name as the one you installed)
previous installations could be overwritten.
