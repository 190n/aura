# Installing AUR Packages

Let's walk through the full process of installing an AUR package. This will show
us how to discover packages, how to install them, and how to deal with problems.

## Installing a Package

### Searching for a Package

Let's say we want to install a package that can render `.md` files for us.
First, we search the AUR for candidates:

```
> aura -As readme
aur/gtk3-mushrooms 3.24.11-1 (28 | 1.29)
    GTK3 patched for classic desktops like XFCE or MATE. Please see README.
aur/python-grip-git 4.5.2-1 (15 | 0.00)
    Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them.
aur/python-grip 4.5.2-1 (13 | 0.14)
    Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them
aur/gtk3-classic 3.24.14-1 (7 | 1.63)
    GTK3 patched for classic desktops like XFCE or MATE. Please see README.
aur/ruby-github-markup 3.0.4-1 (4 | 0.00)
    The code GitHub uses to render README.markup
... etc ...
```

By default, results are ordered by their vote count. If `-As` filled the screen
and we only wish to see a few results, we can filter with `--head`:

```
> aura -As readme --head 3
aur/gtk3-mushrooms 3.24.11-1 (28 | 1.28)
    GTK3 patched for classic desktops like XFCE or MATE. Please see README.
aur/python-grip-git 4.5.2-1 (15 | 0.00)
    Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them.
aur/python-grip 4.5.2-1 (13 | 0.14)
    Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them
```

`--abc` can be used to sort alphabetically instead.

### Scrutinizing a Package

Alright, `python-grip` looks good. Let's take a closer look...

```
> aura -Ai python-grip
Repository  : aur
Name        : python-grip
Version     : 4.5.2-1
AUR Status  : Up to Date
Maintainer  : craftyguy
Project URL : https://github.com/joeyespo/grip
AUR URL     : https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-grip
License     : MIT
Depends On  : python python-docopt python-flask python-markdown python-path-and-address python-pygments python-requests
Build Deps  : python-setuptools
Votes       : 13
Popularity  : 0.14
Description : Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them
```

Does the PKGBUILD look alright?

```
> aura -Ap python-grip
# Maintainer: Clayton Craft <clayton at craftyguy dot net>

pkgname=python-grip
pkgver=4.5.2
pkgrel=1
pkgdesc="Preview GitHub Markdown files like Readme locally before committing them"
arch=('any')
license=('MIT')
url="https://github.com/joeyespo/grip"
depends=('python' 'python-docopt' 'python-flask' 'python-markdown'
         'python-path-and-address' 'python-pygments' 'python-requests')
makedepends=('python-setuptools')
source=("$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz::https://github.com/joeyespo/grip/archive/v$pkgver.tar.gz")
sha256sums=('bdf8949f33470e9ef9e3f09596b72cda968116ff32f0280baabe837c2ad1b29b')

package() {
  cd grip-$pkgver
  python setup.py install --root="$pkgdir" --optimize=1
  install -Dm644 LICENSE "$pkgdir"/usr/share/licenses/$pkgname/LICENSE
}
```

Looks good, but let's make sure we didn't miss anything by using Aura's PKGBUILD
security scanning:

```
> aura -Ap python-grip | aura -P
```

Okay, no output and no error code, so we should be safe to proceed.

```

A few things to note:

- `python-grip` has both official and AUR dependencies. These have to be built
  and installed in a specific order for `python-grip` to even build.
- Aura calls `makepkg` under the hood. By default, the output of `makepkg` is
  hidden.
- If two or more packages don't depend on each other, they'll be built one after
  another and installed at the same time. This avoids needless user prompting.

### A Verbose Install

But what if we *do* want to see the output from `makepkg`? For long builds (e.g.
[aseprite](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aseprite/)), it can be reassuring
to see the ongoing build output.

Let's add `-x` to `-A`:

```
> sudo aura -Ax python-grip
aura >>= Determining dependencies...

aura >>= Repository dependencies:
python-docopt
python-flask
aura >>= AUR dependencies:
python-path-and-address
aura >>= AUR Packages:

... pacman output ...

```

Wonderful.

### Automatically Removing `makedepends`

There's a difference between the dependencies that a package needs to *build*
and the dependencies it needs to *run*. We call the former *makedepends*. Once a
package is installed, we no longer need its makedepends sitting around on our
machine. Adding `-a` to `-A` will automatically clear them out:

```
> sudo aura -Axa python-grip
aura >>= Determining dependencies...

... the usual ...

Package (1)  Old Version  New Version  Net Change

python-grip  4.5.2-1      4.5.2-1        0.00 MiB

Total Installed Size:  0.34 MiB
Net Upgrade Size:      0.00 MiB

:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]

... pacman output ...
```

Ah, there were none in this case. Since `python-grip` is a Python package, it
never really has `makedepends`. That's okay - it's a good habit to use `-a`,
especially when updating all your AUR packages at once (see below).

### Altering the PKGBUILD Before Building

Sometimes you want to change something specific about how a package is built.
Without an AUR helper, you'd clone the package from the AUR, edit the PKGBUILD,
and then run `makepkg`, handling dependencies yourself.

Aura's `--hotedit` flag will let you edit a PKGBUILD on-the-fly. In the example
below, I added `echo "I CHANGED THE PKGBUILD"` to the build commands:

```
> sudo aura -Axa python-grip --hotedit
[sudo] password for colin:
aura >>= Determining dependencies...

... the usual ...

aura >>= Building python-grip...
aura >>= Would you like to edit the PKGBUILD of python-grip? [Y/n]

... Your EDITOR opens, and your changes are saved to the real PKGBUILD file ...

... normal makepkg output, etc ...
```

Some things to note:

- If `.install` or `.patch` files are present, `--hotedit` will also prompt you
  to edit those.
- You can change the dependency lists, but **this will only affect `makepkg`'s
  dependency resolution, not Aura's**. If you want Aura to skip dependency
  checks completely because you know you're right (and you know `makepkg` will
  succeed after you hotedit), use the `--skipdepcheck` flag. See issue
  [#605](https://github.com/fosskers/aura/issues/605) for more information.
- If you want customizations to a PKGBUILD to apply to all future builds of a
  package, it's recommended that you maintain a separate PKGBUILD and call
  `makepkg` yourself.
