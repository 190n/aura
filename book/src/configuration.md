# Configuring Aura

For certain settings we use all the time (e.g. language, build paths, etc.),
Aura is configurable via `/etc/aura.conf`. If you installed Aura from the AUR,
this file was generated for you automatically. Otherwise, a full template [is
available here](https://github.com/fosskers/aura/blob/master/aura/doc/aura.conf)
and contains all instructions.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can check all configuration options in full detail with `man
> aura.conf`.
