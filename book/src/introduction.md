# The Aura User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide for Aura, a multilingual package manager for Arch Linux.

Aura helps you install and manage software on your system. It provides all the
functionality that `pacman` does, plus more, including system sanity checks,
package analysis, and automated AUR package installation.

New to Aura? Check out [Aura's Philosophy](philosophy.md) or just jump right
into [Installation](install.md)!

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can press `s` at any time to search this book.
