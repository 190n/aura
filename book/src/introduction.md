# The Aura User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide for Aura, a secure, multilingual package manager for
Arch Linux.

Aura's original purpose is as an *AUR helper*, in that it automates the process
of installing packages from the Arch User Repositories. It is, however, capable
of much more.

**You can press `s` at any time to search this book.**
