# The Aura User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide for Aura, a secure, multilingual package manager for
Arch Linux.

Aura's original purpose is as an _AUR helper_, in that it automates the process
of installing packages from the Arch User Repositories. It is, however, capable
of much more.

New to Aura? Check out [Aura's Philosophy](philosophy.md) or just jump right
into [Installation](install.md)!

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can press `s` at any time to search this book.
