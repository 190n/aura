Aura Changelog
==============

1.0.6.0
-------
- New libraries: ColourDiff, Data.Algorithm.Diff, Aura.Pkgbuilds
- Aura.AuraLib split into Aura.General, Aura.Build, Aura.Dependencies

1.0.5.0
-------
- Fixed bug where packages with `+` in their name couldn't be
  searched or built.
- `-As` now allows multi-word searches, as it always should have.

-------
- Added French translation. Thanks to Ma Jiehong!

- Fixed bug where packages with dots in their name wouldn't build.

1.0.3.2
-------
- Moved haskell dependencies out of `makedepends` field and into
  `depends` field in PKGBUILD. Makedepends can usually be ignored
  after building, but haskell packages are a pain to rebuild
  and reregister at every build. It's more realistic to just keep
  them installed. This is what other haskell packages in the AUR
  do as well.
