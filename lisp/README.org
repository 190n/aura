#+title: Aura - Lisp helper code

The Lisp code here is for scripting various tasks related to Aura development;
it isn't Aura itself.

Assuming you have [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sbcl/][Common Lisp]] installed, you can optionally install [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qlot][Qlot]] to
manage dependencies. Then:

#+begin_src bash
qlot install
#+end_src

and the code will be ready to use.
