.SH NAME
.
aura \- A package manager for Arch Linux and the AUR
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.SY aura
.I OPERATION
\*[multi-optional OPTIONS]
\*[multi-optional targets]
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B aura
is a multilingual package manager for Arch Linux.
.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the
Arch User Repositories (AUR),
allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
.
Aura allows
.I all
pacman operations and provides
.I new
custom ones for dealing with AUR packages.
.
.P
Unlike pacman, it is never necessary to prefix aura with sudo. Aura is
internally aware of when sudo is necessary and will prompt the user.
.
.P
Commands below labeled (Pacman) are wrapped Pacman commands and are not
documented further here. See the man page of pacman for those.
.
.SH OPERATIONS
.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " \-\-aursync " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving the
.BR A UR.
.
Default action installs packages from the AUR.
.
After building, the built

.
Default action stores a record of all currently installed packages and their
versions.

.
Perform actions involving the package
.BR C ache.
.
Default action downgrades specified

.SH AUR SYNC OPTIONS (\fR\-A\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-delmakedeps
.
Uninstalls build dependencies that are no longer required after installing the
main package.
.
This prevents the creation of orphan packages.
.
Also note that while the package itself will be uninstalled,
its package file will remain in the cache.
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean
.
After a package's tarball has been built and copied to the package cache,
delete its build directory immediately.
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-info " \*[packages]"
.
View information about AUR
.IR packages .
.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-open " \*[packages]"
.
Open the given package's AUR page in a browser.
.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-pkgbuild " \*[packages]"
.
View PKGBUILDs of AUR
.IR packages .
.
Use this before installing new packages to confirm that the build scripts
aren't doing anything fishy.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search " \*[multi word]"
.
Search the AUR for packages containing
.IR word s
(not regex) in their names or descriptions.
.
Multiple terms will narrow down the search.
.
Results are sorted by votes.
.
Suboptions:
.
.RS
.
.  TP
.  B \-\-abc
.
Sorts results alphabetically.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-limit =\fIN\fR
.
Only show the first
.I N
results.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
.
Only print matching package names.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse
.
Reverse the order of the search results.
.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-sysupgrade
.
Upgrade all installed AUR packages.
.
Suboptions:
.
.RS
.
.  TP
.  BR \-d ", " \-\-dryrun
.
Show available upgrades, but do not perform them.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-k ", " \-\-diff
.
View diffs of PKGBUILDs before building.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-ignore \ \fIpackage\fR
.
Don't consider a given package for upgrades. Can be passed more than once. See also the \fBignores\fR list in Aura's configuration to ensure that certain packages are never upgraded.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-git
.
Rebuild all git/svn/hg/etc. packages as well.
.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-provides \ \fIpackage\fR
.
Search the AUR for packages that "provide" some package identity. The same
suboptions available for \fI\-s\fR also apply here. Example:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -Av gcc
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
This would yield a list of packages that "are" gcc for the purposes of
dependency resolution.
.
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\-clone " \*[packages]"
.
Clone the repository of the given package(s).
.
.
.TP
.BR \-y ", " \-\-refresh
.
Pull the latest changes for every local copy of an AUR package.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-build " path"
.
Specify build
.I path
when building AUR packages.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-builduser " user"
.
Specify the
.I user
to build packages as.
.
This can be useful when logged in as root and a build user is available.
.
.TP
.B \-\-hotedit
.
Before building, prompt the user if they wish to view/edit the
.IR PKGBUILD ,
as well as any
.IR .install " or " .patch
files.
.
However, research into packages (and by extension, their PKGBUILDs) should be
done by the user before any building occurs.
.
Please use
.BR \-Ai " and " \-Ap
for this,
as they will be much faster at presenting information than searching the AUR
website manually.
.
.TP
.B \-\-nocheck
.
Do not consider checkdeps when building packages. This will also be passed down
to makepkg, such that the check() function of the PKGBUILD will not run.
.
.TP
.B \-\-shellcheck
.
Run shellcheck on PKGBUILDs before building.
.
.TP
.B \-\-skipdepcheck
.
Perform no dependency solving.
.
Consider this when using
.B \-\-hotedit
to avoid building annoying dependencies that aren't necessary for your special
use-case.
.
.SH GLOBAL PACKAGE STATE OPTIONS (\fR\-B\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean \c
.I " states-to-retain
.
Retains a given number of the most recently saved package states and removes the
rest.
.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-restore
.
Restores a record kept with
.BR \-B .
.
Attempts to downgrade any packages that were upgraded since the chosen save.
.
Will remove any that weren't installed at the time.
.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list
.
Show all saved package state filenames.
.
.SH DOWNGRADE OPTIONS (\fR\-C\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-backup \c
.I " path
.
Backup the package cache to a given directory.
.
The given directory must already exist.
.
During copying, progress will be shown.
.
If the copy takes too long,
you may want to reduce the number of older versions of each package by using
.BR \-Cc .
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean \c
.I " versions-to-retain
.
Retains a given number of package versions for each package,
and deletes the rest from the package cache.
.
Count is made from the most recent version, so using:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -Cc 3
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
would save the three most recent versions of each package file.
.
Giving the number 0 as an argument is identical to
.BR \-Scc .
.
.TP
.B \-\-notsaved
.
Remove only those package files which are not saved in a package record (a la
.BR \-B ).
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search \c

If there are less than five actions ever performed with the package,
what is available will be printed.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search \c
.I " regex

Search the pacman log file via a
.IR regex .

.I packages

.SH PRO TIPS
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
If you build a package and then choose not to install it,
the built package file will still be moved to the cache.
You can then install it whenever you want with
.BR \-C .
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
Research packages using
.BR \-Ad \ ( \-\-deps ),
.BR \-Ai \ ( \-\-info )
and
.BR \-Ap \ ( \-\-pkgbuild )!
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
When upgrading, use
.B \-Akua
instead of just
.BR \-Au .
.
This will remove make deps, as well as show PKGBUILD diffs before building.
.
.SH SEE ALSO
.
.BR aura.conf (5),
.BR pacman (8),
.BR pacman.conf (5),
.BR makepkg (8)
.
.SH BUGS
.
It is not recommended to install non-AUR packages with pacman or aura.
.
Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a
.B \-Au
and attempt to upgrade them.
.
If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is a legitimate AUR package with
the same name as the one you installed) previous installations could be
overwritten.
