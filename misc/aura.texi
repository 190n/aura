Aura 4.0.0 by Colin Woodbury and contributors, 2012 - 2024

Aura helps you install and manage software on your system. It provides
all the functionality that @code{pacman} does, plus more, including
system sanity checks, package analysis, and automated AUR package
installation.

@node Philosophy
@chapter Philosophy
@cindex Guiding principles for Aura's development @subentry philosophy

The Aura project began in 2012 as an answer to the shortcomings of
programs often called @emph{AUR helpers}. Certain ground rules were set
in the beginning to guide development. They are:

@heading Aura is Pacman

Aura doesn't just mimic @code{pacman}; it @strong{is} @code{pacman}. All
@code{pacman} operations and their sub-options are accepted, as-is.

@heading Arch is Arch - AUR is AUR

Aura does not augment or alter Pacman's commands in any way.

@code{-S} yields repository packages and @emph{only} those. In Aura, the
@code{-A} operation is introduced for obtaining AUR packages. @code{-A}
comes with sub-options you're used to (@code{-u}, @code{-s}, @code{-i},
etc.) and adds new ones to enhance AUR interaction.

@heading Downgradibility

Aura allows you to downgrade individual packages to previous versions
with @code{-C}. It also handles snapshots of your entire system, so that
you can roll back whole sets of packages when problems arise. The option
@code{-B} will save a package state, and @code{-Br} will restore a state
you select. @code{-Au} also invokes a save automatically.

@heading Independence

Aura has its own configuration file, its own local package cache, and
its own @url{https://git.sr.ht/~fosskers/faur, Metadata Server} called
the Faur. The Faur in particular helps reduce traffic to the main AUR
server and allows us to provide unique package lookup schemes not
otherwise available.

@heading Multilingualism

English is the dominant language of computing and the internet. That
said, it's natural that some people are going to be more comfortable
working in their native language. From the beginning, Aura has been
built with multiple-language support in mind, making it very easy to add
new ones via the @url{https://projectfluent.org/,,Project Fluent}
format.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation
@cindex Installing Aura

Aura is software specific to @url{https://www.archlinux.org/,,Arch
Linux}. It should also work on Arch-derivatives like
@url{https://manjaro.org/, Manjaro}, but would not be useful on any
other Linux distribution.

There are several @code{aura} packages available. Aura was originally
written in Haskell, but a port to Rust was released in 2024 as the `4.x`
series.

@node From the AUR
@section From the AUR
@cindex Installing from the AUR

@heading The Tagged Release

The recommended package is simply named @code{aura}. It uses
@code{cargo} to build a fresh binary on your machine, based on releases
made to Rust's crates.io.

@example
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura.git
cd aura
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U <the-package-file-that-makepkg-produces>
@end example

@heading The git-based Build

If instead you'd like to directly track updates to Aura's @code{master}
branch, install the git variant:

@example
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura-git.git
cd aura-git
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U <the-package-file-that-makepkg-produces>
@end example

@heading The Prebuilt Binary

Finally, if you don't wish to build Aura yourself or want to avoid any
trace of Rust tooling on your machine, there is a prebuilt binary of
Aura for @code{x86_64} machines:

@example
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura-bin.git
cd aura-bin
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U <the-package-file-that-makepkg-produces>
@end example

@node Building from Source
@section Building from Source
@cindex Building Aura yourself

If you already have Rust tooling installed on your machine and/or wish
to help develop Aura, you can also install it manually:

@example
git clone https://github.com/fosskers/aura.git
cd aura/rust
cargo install --path aura-pm
@end example

This will build and install the binary to @code{/home/YOU/.cargo/bin/}.

Keep in mind that this variant of Aura won't be tracked in Pacman's
database, and so it will be easier to miss updates. It also does not
install completions or other documentation files like manpages.

@node Post-installation
@section Post-installation
@cindex Post-installation

The first thing you should do is run @code{check}:

@example
aura check
@end example

This will scan your system for irregularities and suggest fixes. Second,
you should generate an Aura config file:

@example
aura conf --gen > ~/.config/aura/config.toml
@end example

Consider setting the @code{language} field here, if you wish to use Aura
in a language other than English. The available language codes are
viewable via:

@example
aura stats --lang
@end example

Aura will also automatically detect your locale via @code{LANG}, so you
only need to set @code{language} if you want a custom combination of
system language and Aura language.

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

@quotation
@strong{Attention}: As of the 4.x series, @code{sudo} is no longer
necessary when running Aura. When escalated privileges are required,
Aura will automatically prompt you.

@cindex Basic Usage

@heading Pacman Commands
@cindex Simple Pacman Commands

First and foremost, Aura is compatible with @code{pacman}. This gives us
access to the following commands:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{-S}: Search and install official packages.

@example
> aura -S firefox
@end example

@item
@code{-Q}: Query the database of installed packages.

@example
> aura -Qi firefox
Name            : firefox
Version         : 127.0.2-1
Description     : Fast, Private & Safe Web Browser
... etc ...
@end example

@item
@code{-R}: Remove installed packages.

@example
> aura -R firefox
@end example

@item
@code{-U}: Install a manually built package.

@example
> makepkg
... building ...
> aura -U aura-4.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
@end example

@item
@code{-D}: Interact with Pacman's database directly.

@example
> aura -Dk
No database errors have been found!
@end example

@item
@code{-F}: Make queries regarding files owned by packages.

@example
> aura -Fl firefox
firefox usr/
firefox usr/bin/
firefox usr/bin/firefox
firefox usr/lib/
firefox usr/lib/firefox/
firefox usr/lib/firefox/Throbber-small.gif
firefox usr/lib/firefox/application.ini
... etc ...
@end example

@item
@code{-T}: Check if a dependency is satisfied.

@example
> aura -T firefox "qt>100"
qt>100
@end example
@end itemize

See @ref{Aura-as-Pacman} for a list of common Pacman idioms.
