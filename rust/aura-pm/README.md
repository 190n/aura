Aura is a package manager for Arch Linux. For a full description, see its [main

Guide](https://fosskers.github.io/aura/).

## Installation

This will install the executable `aura` to `~/.cargo/bin/`. However, as this
will not include manual files or completions, it is recommended that you install
Aura via the official AUR packages.
